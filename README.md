TodoApp
This app is my personal assignment to learn basic to advanced concepts through Android app development.
This app has SignIn and SignUp features, add task, edit task and delete task features. 
Also changing themes from light to dark or viceversa provided using option menu.
Used Room database to store user information.
Used SharedPreferences to handle session management. Used Jetpack Android architecture components: LiveData and ViewModel
Some screens are coded in kotlin.
